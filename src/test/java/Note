One repo for one single project
No subRepos are advised

1.Decide the location where to create the repository and navigate my MR terminal to that particular directory
2.intitalize an empty repository  git init---> to initalize an empty repository
to delete a repo, simply delete the .git folder
3.git status--> shows u untacked files in red color
            --> shows u the tracked files ingreen color
4.git add . --> moves all the files to the staging area ..
5. git commit -m "commit message" --> sends all the files from the staging area to the local repo
6. git status after the commit shows working tree clean  becuase  we have
   all the threee stages i.e working directory , staging area and local repo synchronised
